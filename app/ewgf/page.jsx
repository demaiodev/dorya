                    In the Tekken series, the Electric Wind God Fist (commonly called an "electric" or "EWGF") is the
                    signature move of the Mishima family. The EWGF has the same input as the regular Wind God Fist, but
                    is a "just frame" version, and will be executed instead of the Wind God Fist if the player inputs
                    the d/f input and the 2 input on the exact same frame.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to the EWGF's versatile nature and speed, it is a vital asset in every Mishima player's arsenal,
                    especially for Kazuya. The EWGF is the safest launcher for Mishimas and is a useful punishing tool
                    after whiffing an attack of your opponent.

                    This app will help you practice the EWGF by showing you the input you need to perform, and
                    displaying the input history of your controller.
